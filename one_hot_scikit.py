from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer


# To create a Count Vectorizer, we simply need to instantiate one.
# There are special parameters we can set here when making the vectorizer, but
# for the most basic example, it is not needed.
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

# For our text, we are going to take some text from our previous blog post
# about count vectorization
sample_text = ["One of the most basic ways we can numerically represent words "
               "is through the one-hot encoding method (also sometimes called "
               "count vectorizing)."]

# To actually create the vectorizer, we simply need to call fit on the text
# data that we wish to fix
vectorizer.fit(sample_text)

# Now, we can inspect how our vectorizer vectorized the text
# This will print out a list of words used, and their index in the vectors

# If we would like to actually create a vector, we can do so by passing the
# text into the vectorizer to get back counts

# Our final vector:
print('Full vector: ')
print(vector.toarray())

# Or if we wanted to get the vector for one word:
print('Hot vector: ')
print(vectorizer.transform(['hot']).toarray())

# Or if we wanted to get multiple vectors at once to build matrices
print('Hot and one: ')
print(vectorizer.transform(['hot', 'one']).toarray())

# We could also do the whole thing at once with the fit_transform method:
print('One swoop:')
